Known issues with HDP-1.0.0-Preview-1 ========================================= • Installation must be performed as the root user. The cluster must be configured to allow the root user to do password-less ssh between any two servers in the cluster. • This version is certified for use on RHEL 5 only. RHEL 6 and CentOS 5 and 6 are in process of being certified. • This version does not yet support debs for Debian and Ubuntu installation. • This version of gsInstaller.sh does not yet support cluster upgrades. • In this version, all servers in the cluster must be on the Internet, to access the repositories, and all servers independently download the Apache artifacts. In future versions, only the primary install server will access the repositories, once, then copy the artifacts over the LAN to the other servers in the cluster. • If JDK installation is requested, it may fail on some servers due to problems downloading from the provider. If you encounter this problem, install the JDK on all cluster servers before running gsInstaller. • This version of the installer does not push in parallel, so large clusters may take a while to deploy (approximately 30 sec per server). Also, communications problems during install may result in very long timeouts. • Apache Hadoop is installed with the basic set of configuration which is part of the Apache Hadoop rpm. Configuration may be changed after installation, but this version of the installer does not assist in doing so. • Apache HBase is not configured for HA, as zookeeper is configured only on the hbase master node. • The installer installs Datanodes, Tasktrackers and HBase regionservers on the same nodes, as standard practice. • User must provide a mysql instance accessible from the cluster, while installing HCatalog. Secure deploys: ================== • It is recommended that the user creates keytabs and principals for secure deploys. • The provided script setupKerberos can be used as a reference. • User should install the security policy jars if JAVA_HOME is set by the user during secure deployment. Patches ================ • HBase rpm is patched to include HBASE-3606, HBASE-4415, HBASE-4498 and HBASE-4523.
